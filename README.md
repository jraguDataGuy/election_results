# Election Results
## Overview - What is our Purpose?
One of the greatest things about being American is our ability to participate in the democratic election process. In this exercise, we were presented with a .csv file of voter data and were tasked with finding the vote count, percentage, and winner for a recent congressional election. In addition, we looked to find the county with the highest voter turnout.

## Election - Audit Summary/Business Plan for Future Elections
Ultimately, our audit was quick and accurrate in a world that looks for results in record times. As the digital media continues to play a larger role in the elections, it is important to summate this information as fast and accurrately as possible. 
Our code can be modified to fit elections on larger scales:
- We can change our dictionaires to review by states for national elections
- We can add a layer of analysis to breakout by states and by county in our results by defining a separate list and library for states.

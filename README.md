# Election Results
## Overview - What is our Purpose?
One of the greatest things about being American is our ability to participate in the democratic election process. In this exercise, we were presented with a .csv file of voter data and were tasked with finding the vote count, percentage, and winner for a recent congressional election. In addition, we looked to find the county with the highest voter turnout.
